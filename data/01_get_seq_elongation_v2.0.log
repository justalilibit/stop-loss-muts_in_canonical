We are working with 206723 cDNA sequences.
From 18290 genes, 921 don't have a CDS with matched cDNA ENST-IDs (5.04%).

We will drop all mitochondrial genes as theire translaction is more complex and follows different rules than nuclear genes (e.g. often no UTRs)
By dropping MT genes, we went from 18290 to 18277 number of cds', dropping 13 genes

Create mutated sequences from CDS+mutated STOP+3'UTR to next STOP.
Warning: Missing CDS or 3' UTR sequence for gene CDAN1.
STOP codon counts: TAG = 3597, TAA = 4476, TGA = 8000


Translate mutated sequences to amino acid.
For 0 genes, the cds contains an in-frame stop and will be dropped.
We have mutated the CDS from 16073 genes.
This resulted in 100035 peptide sequences from STOPloss mutations.
